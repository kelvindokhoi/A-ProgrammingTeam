# Jim is ready to use machine 1 at time 0
# though if both Jim and another person want to start using a machine at the same time, Jim is polite enough to let the other person go first
# tim can use the machine while the other person is resting
# Jimâ€™s usage sometimes results in the other people having to wait as well
# I should try the naive approach, and then DP it later if necessary, maybe even try branching to shorten the total time.

#a function to return the total time taken by jim and the offset
